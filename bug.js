In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't persisting across sessions, even though I was using the `setPersistence()` method with `LOCAL` persistence enabled.  My code appeared correct, but data would vanish after closing and reopening the app.  I narrowed it down to the specific data path where I was trying to store a complex object containing nested arrays and maps.  The simpler data structures stored correctly, but the complex object consistently failed to persist. I debugged and checked the database rules, and there were no apparent access problems.
